Ideas and features to explore later.

## Results & Tiers

- [ ] Show "viewing X of Y results" based on subscription tier
  - Free tier sees 25 results, paid sees 100+
  - Consider showing upgrade prompt when results are capped
  - Apply to both project search and trials search

---

## UI/UX

- [ ] Update Results panel subtitle based on agent mode
  - Currently shows "NIH RePORTER & USPTO PatentsView" for all modes
  - Trials mode should show different subtitle (e.g., "ClinicalTrials.gov")
  - Consider dynamic subtitle per persona
